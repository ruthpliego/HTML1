        <h1>A Document About Ruth</h1>
        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>This is simply a document that will highlight my minimal knowledge on coding and will be used to talk a little bit about myself</p>

            <h3>About Ruth</h3>
            <dt><b>Experience</b></dt>
            <dd>My experience with coding would have to have come from Adobe &reg; Animate. If one would even consider that coding, the way it is done in Animate is that it is very simplified and almost self explanatory, at least in terms of commands. I will say, knowing this small amount of information made it <em>much</em> &minus; emphasizing on &ldquo;much&rdquo;&minus; easier to grasp on to what the modules we’re telling me, which I am thankful for.</dd>

            <dd>Some of the subjects in school that I like are, math, science and history. Which is pretty much all of them if you really think about it. I enjoy culinary but am <i>terrible</i> at it, and enjoy watching movies. A strange thing I like is learning about diseases and serial killers. One of my favorite things that are palindromes, they fascinate me, and my favorite animal is the Mantis Shrimp.</dd>

                <dd>I live with my parents and younger brother and we have a dog that we care about so much. <br>My family and I really like to travel, it's something I hope to do a lot when I'm older. Creating art is something I like doing and one of the ways I also do that is by editing poctures, I find it all so interesting and fun.<img src="images/dog.JPG" alt="dog" width="300" height="150" class="flowRight"></dd>
                <h3>Why am I in this class?</h3>
                <p>I am studying to become an animator in the future, which requires knowledge in compueters as well as coding, <br><b>and I cannot wait to learn more in this class!</b></p>
